#----------------------------------------------------------
# üîç Key Insights:
#----------------------------------------------------------
# - The **preference for ride type is nearly identical** for both groups.
# - **Electric bikes** are slightly more popular than classic bikes.
# - **Casual riders use classic bikes almost twice as long as members do.**
# - **Casual riders also tend to take longer rides on e-bikes** than members.
# - Possible marketing strategy: Highlight the **cost difference for long rides** 
#   between membership pricing and casual ride pricing.
# - Consider a **bike reservation feature for members** where they can 
#   reserve a bike for a short period at a minimal cost.
